* TODO [0/7]

- [ ] read-only /ruckus bad for non-bootstrapped submodules

  I knew this at one point and forgot apparently... I've been recently
  counting on being able to bootstrap any submod during stage2 once I've
  installed the autotools... but that doesn't work if I've got /ruckus mounted
  read-only.

  I'm going to have to add some sort of prep prior to stage2 to bootstrap any
  remaining submodules.

  Or can I just make them build in-tree (in copied trees)...?  That might work,
  but then all my ruckus-builders are going to bootstrap the trees in question.

- [ ] put guts of bootstrap-early/functions in srp

  This way, we'll have access to build_generic (and its component functions) in
  srp build scriptlets.

- [ ] fix all the FIXMEs in stage1 left over from CLFS 3.0.0 update

- [ ] What to do with flex?

  I've got a git repo that was supposedly at v2.5.37, but w/out any tags.  CLFS
  used 2.5.39, which is tagged but won't bootstrap properly.  It looks like
  they're ironing this all out still upstream, 2.6.0-pre bootstraps and builds
  (albeit, in-tree-only and w/out docs), so I'm using that for now...

- [ ] Proof-of-concept building and installing a brp from within the build
  system.

- [ ] Update srp module to something that actually works

- [ ] Start work on the actual builder process (i.e., CLFS Chapter 10 wrapped
  up in srp goodness)!


* ISSUES (that i might not fix) [0/2]

- [ ] missing brctrl on avlinux host... no networking for ruckus-builder domU.

  I might not bother fixing this... I can get at all the files on the domU
  after the fact and don't see any need to add networking thus far.

- [ ] parallel build problem in gettext?

  died once during stage1...  died again, i swear it was a different place...
  might actually be because i didn't do a distclean first...?  looks like that
  might have been it...
