* TODO

- Proof-of-concept building and installing a brp from within the build system.

- Update srp module to something that actually works

- Start work on the actual builder process (i.e., CLFS Chapter 10 wrapped up in
  srp goodness)!


* Local issues on my box

- missing brctrl on avlinux host... no networking for ruckus-builder domU.


* ISSUES (that i might not fix)

- parallel build problem in gettext? died once during stage1...  died again, i
  swear it was a different place...  might actually be because i didn't do a
  distclean first...?  looks like that might have been it...
