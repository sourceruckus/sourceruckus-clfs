* TODO

- stage2/init: Something's wonky with the bash login via xen console... tab
  corrupts the terminal?  Only happens once we use our inittab that tries to
  start the builder...

  maybe try getty on hvc0 with different speeds (38400, 9600, 115200)... i was
  trying to avoid doing that, because we would have to detect VGA (tty0) vs
  Xen console (hvc0)...

- Forward-port scripts, submodules, and tarballs to CLFS 3.0.0-SYSTEMD.

- Forward-port my make repo to 3.x

- Update srp module to something that actually works

- Start work on the actual builder process (i.e., CLFS  Chapter 10 wrapped up
  in srp goodness)!


* Local issues on my box

- need to umount /scrap in order to start the domu, but that's where
  guest's homedir is... not very convenient...

- missing brctrl on avlinux host... no networking for ruckus-builder domU.


* ISSUES (that i might not fix)

- parallel build problem in gettext? died once during stage1...  died again, i
  swear it was a different place...  might actually be because i didn't do a
  distclean first...?  looks like that might have been it...
