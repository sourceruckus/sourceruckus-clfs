* TODO

- stage2/init: Make sure that if UID or GID already exists, creation doesn't
  fail, and we actually still use them (i.e., don't use the name, use the ID) ?
  maybe just allow GID failure?

- stage2/init: Something's wonky with the bash login via xen console... tab
  corrupts the terminal?  Only happens once we use our inittab that tries to
  start the builder...

- stage1/fstab-generation: Make sure /ruckus gets mounted OK if RUCKUS_DEV but
  RUCKUS_PATH == /

- Forward-port scripts, submodules, and tarballs to CLFS 3.0.0-SYSTEMD.

- Forward-port my make repo to 3.x

- Update srp module to something that actually works

- Add Check-0.9.13 (tarball), Tcl-8.6.1 (tarball), Expect-5.45 (tarball),
  DejaGNU-1.5.1 (git://git.sv.gnu.org/dejagnu.git), Perl-5.20
  (git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git), Python-3.4.x (tarball) for extra /tools
  at beginning of stage2.

- Fix the FIXMEs at the bottom of configure.ac regarding submodule
  bootstrapping...

- Start work on the actual builder process (i.e., CLFS  Chapter 10 wrapped up
  in srp goodness)!

- Upgrade Syslinux to at least 6.03 (tarball)


* Local issues on my box

- need to umount /scrap in order to start the domu, but that's where
  guest's homedir is... not very convenient...

- missing brctrl on avlinux host... no networking for ruckus-builder domU.


* ISSUES (that i might not fix)

- parallel build problem in gettext? died once during stage1...  died again, i
  swear it was a different place...  might actually be because i didn't do a
  distclean first...?  looks like that might have been it...
