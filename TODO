* TODO [0/4]

- [ ] What to do with flex?

  I've got a git repo that was supposedly at v2.5.37, but w/out any tags.  CLFS
  used 2.5.39, which is tagged but won't bootstrap properly.  It looks like
  they're ironing this all out still upstream, 2.6.0-pre bootstraps and builds
  (albeit, in-tree-only and w/out docs), so I'm using that for now...

- [ ] Proof-of-concept building and installing a brp from within the build
  system.

- [ ] Update srp module to something that actually works

- [ ] Start work on the actual builder process (i.e., CLFS Chapter 10 wrapped
  up in srp goodness)!


* ISSUES (that i might not fix) [0/2]

- [ ] missing brctrl on avlinux host... no networking for ruckus-builder domU.

  I might not bother fixing this... I can get at all the files on the domU
  after the fact and don't see any need to add networking thus far.

- [ ] parallel build problem in gettext?

  died once during stage1...  died again, i swear it was a different place...
  might actually be because i didn't do a distclean first...?  looks like that
  might have been it...
