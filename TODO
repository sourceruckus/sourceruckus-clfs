* TODO

- Proof-of-concept building and installing a brp from within the build system.

- Forward-port scripts, submodules, and tarballs to CLFS 3.0.0-SYSTEMD.

- Forward-port my make repo to 3.x

- Update srp module to something that actually works

- Start work on the actual builder process (i.e., CLFS Chapter 10 wrapped up in
  srp goodness)!


* Local issues on my box

- need to umount /scrap in order to start the domu, but that's where
  guest's homedir is... not very convenient...

- missing brctrl on avlinux host... no networking for ruckus-builder domU.


* ISSUES (that i might not fix)

- parallel build problem in gettext? died once during stage1...  died again, i
  swear it was a different place...  might actually be because i didn't do a
  distclean first...?  looks like that might have been it...

- 32bit builds of busybox are segfaulting all over the place, especially
  mdev... which makes life difficult.  (eglibc 2.18-r24148, gcc
  4.8.1-branch_update-3, busybox 1.22.1).  Should try upgrading busybox if this
  still happens after getting the rest of the system up to CLFS 3.0.0.
