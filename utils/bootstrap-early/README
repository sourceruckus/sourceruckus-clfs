README - utils/bootstrap-early

This step prepares us for the bootstrap-cross step.  It installs some extra
necesary tools on the originating host system to ensure that we have
everything needed to complete the build.

All the packages built in this section will get compiled and installed in
$HOME/RUCKUS/Bootstrap-early.  Actually using them will require tweaking of
your user's environment (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc).



* Need
** bison (don't remember why)
** e2fsprogs
** Python
** SRP

* Might be nice to have
** zsh
** emacs
** git



The final result of building in this directory is bootstrap-cross.img, which
can be used by restore to populate a bootstrap-cross environment as the root
user.


** Gotcha's

*** host system's e2fsprogs extensions

Do I need to make a bootstrap-bootstrap section to ensure that the version
of e2fsprogs we're using doesn't enable any non-standard features in the
filesystem we're creating?  If it does, our baby system's kernel probably
won't be able to mount the filesystem... which would be bad.
