README - utils/bootstrap-early

This step prepares us for the bootstrap-cross step.  It installs some extra
necessary tools on the originating host system to ensure that we have
everything needed to complete the build.

All the packages built in this section will get compiled and installed in
$HOME/RUCKUS/Bootstrap-early.  Actually using them will require tweaking of
your user's environment (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc).

Note that this stage assumes the host system at least has git (to get this),
autotools (to configure this), and a sane compilation toolchain (make, gcc,
glibc, etc).


* Need
** e2fsprogs (make sure created rootfs doesn't use vendor extensions)
** help2man (needed for texinfo in bootstrap)

* Might need
** rsync
** dump/restore
** ncurses



* Bootstrap nightmare

Ok, I can't seem to get some of the git checkouts to bootstrap properly...
there's cyclic dependencies all over.  If I install the following from dist
tarballs:

  - autoconf-2.68.tar.bz2
  - automake-1.11.1.tar.bz2
  - bison-2.4.3.tar.bz2
  - gettext-0.18.1.1.tar.bz2
  - gperf-3.0.4.tar.bz2
  - libtool-2.4.tar.bz2
  - m4-1.4.15.tar.bz2
  - make-3.82.tar.bz2
  - pkg-config-0.25.tar.bz2

then I can successfully bootstrap the following source trees:

  - bison (bootstrap*)
  - m4 (bootstrap*)
  - automake (bootstrap)
  - libtool (bootstrap)
  - util-linux (autogen.sh)
  - gettext (autogen.sh*)

like this:

# ./autogen.sh

or like this:

# export $toplevel=$PWD/../..
# GNULIB_SRCDIR=$toplevel/src/gnulib ./bootstrap
