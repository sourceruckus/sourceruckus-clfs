README - utils/bootstrap-early

This step prepares us for the bootstrap-cross step.  It installs some extra
necessary tools on the originating host system to ensure that we have
everything needed to complete the build.

All the packages built in this section will get compiled and installed in
$HOME/RUCKUS/Bootstrap-early.  Actually using them will require tweaking of
your user's environment (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc).
