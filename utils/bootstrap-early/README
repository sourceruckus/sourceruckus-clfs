* README - utils/bootstrap-early

This step prepares us for the bootstrap-cross step.  It installs some extra
necessary tools on the originating host system to ensure that we have
everything needed to complete the build.

All the packages built in this section will get compiled and installed in
$PREFIX_HOSTPREP (defaults to $BUILDROOT/bootstrap-early).  Actually using them
will require tweaking of your user's environment (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc).

Note that this stage assumes the host system at least has git (to get this),
wget (to get other sources), autotools (to configure this), and a sane
compilation toolchain (make, gcc, glibc, etc).

Note also, that even though a sane compilation toolchain is listed as a
requirement, we're going to immediately test this by... bootstrapping and
installing our own GNU bootstrapping toolchain (autoconf, automake, libtool,
etc).  This way, we ensure that the versions of all the compile toolchain
components are adequate for compiling our bootstrap environment.


NOTE: There are cyclic dependencies that crop up when bootstrapping the
      toolchain (i.e., running bootstrap or autogen.sh from git checkouts).  The
      easiest way around this is to download and install the dist source tarball
      of automake (that matches the version we're tracking in our automake git
      submodule) on the host system (it's needed by m4 which is needed to
      bootstrap automake).
