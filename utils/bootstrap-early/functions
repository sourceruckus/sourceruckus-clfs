# this variable tells bootstrap scripts where to find gnulib, to avoid them
# all trying to create their own local clone
#
# NOTE: This variable shouldn't be needed anymore.  We were originally
#       setting this to force bootstrap scripts to shared a common gnulib
#       clone, but they pretty much all had to get hacked up to work right.
#       Now we have our init_submodules script at the toplevel that will
#       recursively reconfigure and clone submodules using shared clones
#       wherever available, so setting this variable would break things.
#
# NOTE: Poo.  Tar doesn't use .gitmodules for gnulib, so it wants to clone
#       still... Either we leave this variable set, which means some trees may
#       setup a submodule, but then not use it, or we write a custom rule for
#       tar that sets GNULIB_SRCDIR just for tar.
#export GNULIB_SRCDIR=$toplevel/src/gnulib

# this variable tells bootstrap scripts (probably just cpio and tar) to use
# our paxutils submodule instead of cloning their own.
#
# NOTE: If tar used .gitmodules for paxutils, this wouldn't be needed.
#       However, the tar boostrap script just does a git clone instead of
#       using submodules.  At least, for now...
