# NOTE: The CLFS book puts the cross-compilation toolcahin in /cross-tools

#       /tools.  Both of these are actually symlinks pointing into
#       $CLFS/cross-tools and $CLFS/tools.  I don't remember the rationale
#       for doing this at the moment, but for simplicity's sake we're going
#       to follow the CLFS book to a tee (at least, early on).
#
#       For the record, ditching the symlinks and installing directly into
#       $CLFS does indeed cause breakage in the CLFS instructions...

# --- CLFS Variables ------------------------------------------------------

# this is where our baby filesystem lives while we're building it.  the
# bootstrap_install target will install it in an appropraite place with
# appropriate permissions.  keeping it inside a different directory until then
# make maintainence easier (e.g., chown -R root:root $CLFS won't mess with our
# source tree)
#
# FIXME: sandbox target just broke this... sorta.  sandbox will create
#        /mnt/sandbox/ruckus at the get go.  we'll still be building/installing
#        into /mnt/sandbox/ruckus/.build/baby, but we'll want to be sure to
#        chown prior to installing into /mnt/sandbox/
#
# FIXME: thinking about moving all the sandbox stuff into a build wrapper
#        script in a different git tree...
#
# FIXME: Do we want to change this variable to point at the installed system
#        during/after the install target?  In other words, prior to installing
#        it would be /mountpoint/ruckus/.build/baby, but afterwards it would be
#        /mountpoint.

#
# NOTE: I would have called these MACHTYPE_HOST, MACHTYPE_TARGET, and
#       MACHTYPE_TARGET32, but we're using the CLFS variables so we can
#       cut-n-paste build scripts.
#
# NOTE: This needs to NOT be a normal host string just in case our target
#       system actually happens to be the same as our host system (which
#       would break the cross-compilation scheme we're using here).

# these variables seem like overkill, but are used in the CLFS book, so
# we'll follow suit.
#
# NOTE: We also use these variables to determine what we're building.  If we're
#       buliding plain old 32bit, only BUILD32 will be set.  Pure64 x86_64 will
#       have just BUILD64 set.  x86_64 Multilib will have both.
#
# x86: BUILD32 and BUILD64 are both unused
#
# x86_64 pure: BUILD64 is used for bootstrap-cross eglibc (and a conditional in
#              binutils), bootstrap-stage1 everything.  It's completely unused
#              in bootstrap-stage2 and final system
#
# x86_64 multi: BUILD64 and BUILD32 are used for bootstrap-cross eglibc*.  All
#               of bootstrap-stage1 and bootstrap-stage2 is built using BUILD64
#               ONLY.  Final system software is built using both BUILD32 and
#               BUILD64.
#
# If we follow that scheme (i.e, don't set either if arch is x86), then having
# BUILD32 set means we're x86_64 multilib... which is going to get pretty
# confusing... perhaps we should just have a MULTILIB variable?
#
export BUILD32=@BUILD32@
export BUILD64=@BUILD64@

# NOTE: This variable seems to only be set in the embedded CLFS book and
#       is used by busybox and the linux kernel.
#
# NOTE: This is also a little misleading.  When building for i686, this needs
#       to be set to i386 for historical purposes (i.e., kbuild expects x86 32
#       bit files to be in the i386 dir).
export CLFS_ARCH=@CLFS_ARCH@

# NOTE: This extra variable refers to the "architecture" of the CLFS book
#       (e.g., i686, x86_64, x86_64-64).  It's different than the
#       CLFS_ARCH variable which refers solely to the cpu architecture
#       (i.e., implies nothing regarding multilib vs pure).
