README - utils/bootstrap-cross

This is where the build scripts for a cross-compiling bootstrap system will
live.  The scripts in utils/bootstrap (native bootstrap) might get merged in
here if that's easier to maintain, but we'll see.


The final result of building in this directory is bootstrap-cross.img, which
can be used by restore to populate a bootstrap-cross environment as the root
user.
