README - utils/bootstrap-cross

This step builds a cross-compiling toolchain.  The resulting executables
will be used to compile the bootstrap-final step for the correct
architecture.

All the packages built in this section will get compiled and installed in
$HOME/RUCKUS/bootstrap-cross.  Actually using them will require tweaking of
your user's environment.


NOTE: This is all actually getting installed in $BABY/bootstrap-cross at the
      moment, but I don't remember why I implemented it that way... might
      have been a mistake... but I seem to remember there being some reason
      why I had to do it that way.

NOTE: Did it that way to follow the CLFS book, which says it installs in
      $CLFS/cross-tools just to be consistent with $CLFS/tools.  Should be
      able to move these things around later and see what breaks.


NOTE: If this really does have to go inside $BABY, we should dump an image
      when we're done.  This stage takes almost 2 hours to build on my
      netbook, even on subsequent runs that are mostly just doing 'make
      install'.
