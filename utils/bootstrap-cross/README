README - utils/bootstrap-cross

This step builds a cross-compiling toolchain.  The resulting executables
will be used to compile the bootstrap-final step for the correct
architecture.

All the packages built in this section will get compiled and installed in
$HOME/RUCKUS/bootstrap-cross.  Actually using them will require tweaking of
your user's environment.
