* README - utils/bootstrap-cross

This step builds a cross-compiling toolchain.  The resulting executables
will be used to compile the bootstrap-stage1 step for the correct
architecture.

All the packages built in this section will get compiled and installed in
$BUILDROOT/baby/$PREFIX_CROSS (via the /tools-cross symlink).  Actually using
them will require tweaking of your user's environment.


NOTE: Kernel headers and glibc (32 and 64bit) are actually installed in
      $PREFIX_FINAL (/tools) here.  This is what the CLFS book does, and
      we follow suit... even though I'm not entirely sure why this is done.
      It does mean that the final bootstrap stage doesn't have to compile
      eglibc at all...
