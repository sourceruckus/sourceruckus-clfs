README - utils/bootstrap-cross

This is where the build scripts for a cross-compiling bootstrap system will
live.  The scripts in utils/bootstrap (native bootstrap) might get merged in
here if that's easier to maintain, but we'll see.


The final result of building in this directory is bootstrap-cross.img, which
can be used by restore to populate a bootstrap-cross environment as the root
user.


** Gotcha's

*** host system's e2fsprogs extensions

Do I need to make a bootstrap-bootstrap section to ensure that the version
of e2fsprogs we're using doesn't enable any non-standard features in the
filesystem we're creating?  If it does, our baby system's kernel probably
won't be able to mount the filesystem... which would be bad.
