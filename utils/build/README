* README - utils/build

This is where the build scripts for each installable image will live


** bootstrap.img

This should be our final bootstrap system, saved for later.  Just in case.

NOTE: This should exclude the /ruckus directory.

NOTE: We should double-check for remaining symlinks back into /bootstrap for
      each of the subsequent images... we want to exclude /bootstrap and all
      references to it.


** embedded.img

Maybe have an image that's just kernel, eglibc, and busybox (installed
appropriately outside of /bootstrap)?


** tiny.img

As small as possible... just the basic CLFS system?  There's almost no point
in this, since this image won't be very usable...  But it will give us a
clear delineation between the core CLFS packages and Source Ruckus.

NOTE: Actually, we probably won't have a pure basic CLFS system... we'll be
      straying from the book quite frequently (e.g., busybox instead of tons
      of stuff, zsh and ash instead of bash)

NOTE: I suspect that tiny.img and base.img are going to merge together into
      a single base.img... we'll see.


** base.img

Add a small selection of extra things we'll want (ssh, zsh, emacs, python,
srp) for a text-mode only basic system.  This should be fully functional, though.

NOTE: I wonder if we can squeeze some basic Xlibs and latex into
      this... might increase disk usage pretty dramatically though...

NOTE: this should do almost nothing outside of providing a sane tiny system.


** server.img

This should add everything needed to be a full featured headless server.
Maybe up to X libs, but no X server.  (that would mean no XDMCP,
though... of course, what's the point of XDMCP support if there's no desktop
environment installed)


** workstation.img

This should add everything needed for a tidy workstation installation (e.g.,
LXDE, fluxbox, firefox, thunderbird, libreoffice, latex, maybe some small
multimedia tools).


** extra.img

Everything else.  This is the complete dev system with everything and the
kitchen sink thrown in.

Big Fat Desktop Environments (GNOME, KDE), java, seamonkey, additional
multimedia stuff.

ALL debug symbols added back in!
