README - utils/build

This is where the build scripts for each installable image will live

** bootstrap.img

This should be our bootstrap system, saved for later.  Just in case.


** tiny.img

As small as possible... just the basic CLFS system?  There's almost no point
in this, since this image won't be very usable...  But it will give us a
clear delineation between the core CLFS packages and Source Ruckus.


** base.img

Add a small selection of extra things we'll want (ssh, zsh, emacs, python,
srp) for a text-mode only basic system.  This should be fully functional, though.

NOTE: I wonder if we can squeeze some basic Xlibs and latex into
      this... might increase disk usage pretty dramatically though...

NOTE: this should do almost nothing outside of providing a sane tiny system.


** server.img

This should add everything needed to be a full featured headless server.
Maybe up to X libs, but no X server.  (that would mean no XDMCP,
though... of course, what's the point of XDMCP support if there's no desktop
environment installed)


** workstation.img

This should add everything needed for a tidy workstation installation (e.g.,
LXDE, fluxbox, firefox, thunderbird, libreoffice, latex, maybe some small
multimedia tools).


** extra.img

Everything else.  This is the complete dev system with everything and the
kitchen sink thrown in.

Big Fat Desktop Environments (GNOME, KDE), java, seamonkey, additional
multimedia stuff.

ALL debug symbols added back in!
