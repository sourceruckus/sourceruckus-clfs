#        mem will depend on how much mem is availalbe in reality, but also

#        but they'll be thrown off if we're configuring from in Xen...

#       (via xl from dom0).
#
#       That's all probably completely irrelevant for our bootstrap
#       builder.  We set it explictly to 1 here just to keep the kernel
#       from spitting out scarry sounding PCI failure messages during boot.
