# FIXME: detect mem for domU in configure?  maybe just default to 1024M
#        but add --with-domu-ram?
#
#        mem will depend on how much mem is availalbe in reality, but also
#        on how much has been reserved for dom0 in the bootloader
#        config...  could look at /proc/meminfo and do some calculations,
#        but they'll be thrown off if we're configuring from in Xen...
#
#        also, it will depend on how many ruckus-builder guests are going
#        to be run in parallel.
#
# FIXME: I might be running out of ram building the glibc package w/ 8
#        cores and 2G of RAM in a domU... can't quite nail down why it's
#        aperiodically failing to compile.  I've increased to 4G in my
#        builder and haven't had it fail again (yet?).
#
#        Do I need to make sure I have at least cores/2 Gigs of RAM to
#        make sure I have enough RAM to service building in parallel w/
#        that many cores?

# NOTE: This tells Xen to expose the host memory map to the guest,

#       to be explicitly set to 1 to allow for PCI passthrough post-bootup
#       (via xl from dom0).
#
#       That's all probably completely irrelevant for our bootstrap
#       builder.  We set it explictly to 1 here just to keep the kernel
#       from spitting out scarry sounding PCI failure messages during boot.
