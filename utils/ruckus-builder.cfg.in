#
#        mem will depend on how much mem is availalbe in reality, but also

#        config...  could look at /proc/meminfo and do some calculations,
#        but they'll be thrown off if we're configuring from in Xen...
#
#        also, it will depend on how many ruckus-builder guests are going
#        to be run in parallel.

#       to be explicitly set to 1 to allow for PCI passthrough post-bootup
#       (via xl from dom0).
#
#       That's all probably completely irrelevant for our bootstrap

#       from spitting out scarry sounding PCI failure messages during boot.
