* ISSUES

** final / ownership should be root:root

** touch /etc/mtab

** should remind user about correcting /etc/fstab

** bootscript warnings are uuuugly.  lotso dots...................

** 'mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt' works, but type is required...



* ROOTFS size

If we're concerned with rootfs size, the first thing to do is strip debug
like this:

# find $CLFS -type f --exec strip --strip-debug {} \;

Do NOT do this from within the bootstrap system.  It must be done from the
host system or strip will hose the strip binary.

This brings our rootfs size down to about 138M for 32bit builds.

And there's still a bunch of waste in /tools/{man,info,share}
