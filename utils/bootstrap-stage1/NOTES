* ISSUES

** final / ownership should be root:root

** touch /etc/mtab

** should remind user about correcting /etc/fstab

** bootscript warnings are uuuugly.  lotso dots...................

** 'mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt' works, but type is required...



* ROOTFS size

If we're concerned with rootfs size, the first thing to do is strip debug
like this:

# find $CLFS -type f --exec strip --strip-debug {} \;

Do NOT do this from within the bootstrap system.  It must be done from the
host system or strip will hose the strip binary.

This brings our rootfs size down to about 138M for 32bit builds.

And there's still a bunch of waste in /tools/{man,info,share}


* Busybox

Should we install busybox in the actual root filesystem (as apposed to /tools)?
Right now, we install it in /tools, but then populate the rootfs with zillions
of symlinks.

I guess a bigger question is: Are we going to replace ALL of busybox in the
final system?  If we are, then it makes sense to leave it in /tools.  If not,
it make more sense to install in / and then just overwrite symlinks of the bits
that we're replacing with full-blown versions.

FIXME: If we install in /, we'll end up with a busybox binary on our final
       system (which could come in handy!) that's linked against the glibc
       built in bootstrap-cross... This might be problematic...

       Alternatively, we could rebuild busybox during the final build stage
       (via SRP), link it against the appropriate glibc, and only create needed
       symlinks...


* Kernel

Pretty much having the same thoughts as busybox... Do we really need the stage1
kernel to be different than the final kernel?
