- remove /bootstrap-cross
- strip-all in /bootstrap/{bin,sbin}
- 229M of static libs in /bootstrap/lib{,64}
- strip-all in /bootstrap/libexec/gcc
- 16.4M of docs in /bootstrap/share/doc
- removed /bootstrap/{info,man}*

- there's lots of stuff in /bootstrap/share:

32.0K	aclocal
468.0K	bison
4.0K	doc
56.0K	gcc-4.5.2
20.0K	getopt
9.1M	i18n
13.7M	info
11.6M	locale
3.1M	man
1.7M	misc
20.0K	tabset
6.3M	terminfo
36.0K	texinfo
5.5M	zoneinfo
51.7M	total

- removed all info and man

- there's still 30M or so of language cruft in /bootstrap/share...

- removed i18n/*, locale/*, zoneinfo/*, 

- that brings us to 193M, but I don't know if i've busted anything...

- crud, looks like gcc is busted w/out some of the static libs... at least it needs libc_noshared.a


- bootscript warnings are uuuugly.  lotso dots...................

- 'mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt' works, but type is required...


- in order for the bootstrap system to really be fully-functional, we're gonna
  need the following:

  - ssh (openssl/openssh, or dropbear (the embedded alernative))
  - python
  - srp
  - rsync?
  - git?
  - emacs?
  - zsh?
  - the tools added at the beginning of the next CLFS chapter (expect, etc)
