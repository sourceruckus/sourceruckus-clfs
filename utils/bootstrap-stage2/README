* README - utils/bootstrap-stage2

This is the second half of the final bootstrap stage.  As mentioned before,
final bootstrap creation is split in half as soon as the baby system is
bootable simply because cross-compiling is a pain.  This stage gets kicked
off automatically by init after booting into the new baby system and will
build the remaining bootstrap tools natively.

The end result is a bootstrap system that's not only bootable, it contains
all the tools required to successfully build Source Ruckus.

After this step is complete, the toplevel Makefile can go about building and
installing each individual package, which will eventually result in a
complete system.
