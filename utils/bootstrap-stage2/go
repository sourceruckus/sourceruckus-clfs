# sed, awk, grep), which may not have identical usage.  See similar comment
# block in bootstrap-early/functions for details.

# FIXME: This looks to only be needed by the check targets of kbd and

#        bootstrap and from the final system unless something else we've added
#        needs it.  Of course, if we never do a 'make check', we'll never need

#        for use on embedded systems, but replace it (via the srp build system)
#        with a fully X-capable version later on...
#
#        even if we don't treat it as the tiny.img, we'll want to consider
#        leaving it on the system until we've built through the everything
#        image...  for example, we could build a text-mode emacs in /tools and
#        leave it on the system until after we've built a fully featured (x,
#        pdf, images, etc) emacs later on.  Same goes for Python, which we'll
#        want on small headless systems w/out X, but we'll want Python to
#        magically have the tk module by the time we're done building
#        development workstations.
#
#        the slippery slope here is that we're talking about fielding systems
#        that have cross-compiled gcc/glibc instead of natively-compiled
#        gcc/glibc...
#
#        could always just leave off python, srp, and all the other bootstrap
#        niceeties for fielded systems w/out x...  then add that all in via
#        whatever image adds it later.  In other words, our different tiny
#        embedded variants wouldn't have srp package management available after
#        installation.  This wouldn't be that big of a deal, except that I was
#        planning on using one of those for the bootable installer... which
#        would need srp.  I guess we could base the installer off of the
#        smallest image to include X?

# NOTE: if the bootstrap system is feature-complete for my embedded

#       httpd will suffice.  (although i'll need ImageMagick for photo
#       thumbnail generation)
#
#       nfs: i think i'd have to add nfs-utils for this...  don't
#       think busybox does nfs server.
#
#       dhcp: busybox dhcpd/dnsd functionality isn't sufficient.
#       we'll add dnsmasq to take care of dhcpd and dynamic dns.
#
#       ssh: i need to be able to ssh into the box...  openssl/openssh
#       or dropbear?
#
#       dev tools: i'm gonna need rsync and git.  would probably like
#       to have emacs and zsh, too.
#
#       python: probably need this to use media_utils, etc
#
#       multimedia: speaking of media_utils... that would require at
#       least having ImageMagick.  Maybe also need dvgrab and all the
#       multimedia libs up to ffmpeg...
#
#       syslog: can use busybox's syslogd and klogd, but have to add
#       init scripts or something...
