- bash needed for pushd/popd and shopt (at the very least)

- sudo would be nice, too

- actual work should not get done by rcsysinit... it should be set to run on tty1 via init

- go script must be runnable via absolute path invocation (i.e., don't use $PWD)

- check inittab.  tty1 runs the stage2 script and then starts a getty.
