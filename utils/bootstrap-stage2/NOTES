- /bootstrap is in ~build_user/.profile's PATH but that isn't parsed when
  started via init

  NOTE: I think this is fixed (and/or moot).

- woops, we have 'make install' permissions issues because we're building as
  $build_user

  NOTE: fix this by putting 'sudo' all over the place

- woops, we've got some '-v' flags that don't work (e.g., ln -v)

  NOTE: indeed...

- test error handling for this:

	    pushd $builddir &&
	    sudo make install-private-headers &&
	    sudo ln -sv tclsh8.5 $PREFIX_FINAL/bin/tclsh
	    popd || exit 1

  Does sudo return error if subtask returns error?  or does it only return
  error if auth failed?

  Looks like "real" sudo returns error if subtask does.  Need to double
  check our fake version...  Looks good.


- does busybox tar have -v? yes, it does.
