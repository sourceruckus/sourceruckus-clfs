- bootstrap-early and bootstrap-cross need to be removed from path for
  stage2.  they should probably be removed from the filesystem too.

- /bootstrap is in ~build_user/.profile's PATH but that isn't parsed when
  started via init

- woops, we have 'make install' permissions issues because we're building as
  $build_user

- woops, we've got some '-v' flags that don't work (e.g., ln -v)
