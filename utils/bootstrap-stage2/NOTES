* TODO

In order for the bootstrap system to really be fully-functional, we're gonna
need the following:

  - CLFS Chapter 9 Testsuite Tools (tcl, expect, dejagnu)
  - CLFS Chapter 10, section 4 temporary perl

  - python
  - srp

We might want to add some of the following so that we don't have to wait for
them to be installed in the baby system via srp (e.g., this will be needed
if we want to dump an image before we've installed dump):

  - dump
  - ssh (openssl/openssh, or dropbear (the embedded alernative))
  - rsync
  - git
  - emacs
  - zsh
  - syslinux
