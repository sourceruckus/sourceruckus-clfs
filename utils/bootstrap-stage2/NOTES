- sudo doesn't really work because 'su' is chdiring to ~user

- bootstrap-early and bootstrap-cross need to be removed from path for stage2

- /bootstrap is in ~build_user/.profile's PATH but that isn't parsed when started via init

- woops, we have 'make install' permissions issues because we're building as $build_user

- woops, we've got some '-v' flags that don't work (e.g., ln -v)
