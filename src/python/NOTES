Python doesn't do multilib... so we snag patches from fedora to make sure it's
done right (or at least consistently w/ somebody else).

* Patches
Here's a summary, basically copy-n-pasted from the python3.spec file, of each
patch we're borrowing.

*FIXME*: I might need to rename some of these and conditionally supply
         patches, not sure yet.

** patch1: Python-3.1.1-rpath.patch
: Fixup distutils/unixccompiler.py to remove standard library path from rpath:
: Was Patch0 in ivazquez' python3000 specfile:

** patch102 (only patched for lib64): 00102-lib64.patch
** patch104 (only patched for lib64): 00104-lib64-fix-for-test_install.patch
: Only used when "%{_lib}" == "lib64"
: Another lib64 fix, for distutils/tests/test_install.py; not upstream:

** patch111: 00111-no-static-lib.patch
: Patch the Makefile.pre.in so that the generated Makefile doesn't try to build
: a libpythonMAJOR.MINOR.a (bug 550692):
: Downstream only: not appropriate for upstream

We take this to avoid wasting time/space... probably not really needed.


* do I have to --enable-ipv6 --enable-shared, or are they default?

* the devel package tweaks pyconfig.h for additional multilibiness
Basically, it replaces pyconfig.h w/ pyconfig-32.h and pyconfig-64.h, then
creates a new pyconfig.h like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cat > %{buildroot}%{_includedir}/$PyIncludeDir/pyconfig.h << EOF
#include <bits/wordsize.h>

#if __WORDSIZE == 32
#include "%{_pyconfig32_h}"
#elif __WORDSIZE == 64
#include "%{_pyconfig64_h}"
#else
#error "Unknown word size"
#endif
EOF
#+END_EXAMPLE

And then fixes a few references like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sed -i -e "s/'pyconfig.h'/'%{_pyconfig_h}'/" \
  %{buildroot}%{pylibdir}/distutils/sysconfig.py \
  %{buildroot}%{pylibdir}/sysconfig.py
#+END_EXAMPLE


* it also adds a multilib wrapper, but i think we'll handle that like CLFS

* the spec file byte-compiles everything and makes it rpm content, should we?
