* version
v3.0?  Pretty sure last version was 2.0... 3.0 never actually got out of the
planning stages last time... maybe I should start this at 4.0?  maybe jump
it all the way to 5.0 just to show how much time there's been (mozilla-ish,
i know).  Or it could be 6.x since it's based off version 6.x of the LFS
book... although it's actually following v1.0 of the CLFS book more
closely... i don't konw.
 

* source tree layout
just have everything in a packages directory?  or a src directory?
splitting things up into contrib and src doesn't really make sense...
